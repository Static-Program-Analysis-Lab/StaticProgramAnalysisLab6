    "## &#128214; Exercise 1: Building Points-to Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#127919; Objective\n",
    "So far, our model could be used to perform **intraprocedural** static analysis, which is the examination of individual functions. \n",
    "However, real-world programs have function calls, where data and control flow traverse from one function to another. \n",
    "To capture a more accurate representation of a program's behavior, it's important to extend our analysis beyond the boundaries of single functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we aim to enhance our model to conduct **interprocedural** analysis, enabling it to follow the flow of data and control across function calls. \n",
    "This leap will not only provide a more comprehensive understanding of the program's behavior but will also set the foundation for advanced analysis techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key aspects of interprocedural analysis is the call graph construction.\n",
    "However, to build a call graph, one needs a points-to set for given variables, i.e., we need to perform a points-to analysis. \n",
    "This analysis helps in determining the potential objects a variable can point to, which in turn aids in identifying the possible targets of function calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#128214; Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In program analysis, understanding how data flows and how control is propagated across different procedures is important. \n",
    "This gets particularly significant when dealing with object-oriented or procedural programming paradigms where data and control frequently cross function boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intraprocedural Analysis:** This type of analysis is scoped within a single procedure or function. \n",
    "The control flow graph (CFG) you've built in previous exercises primarily supports intraprocedural analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interprocedural Analysis:** This expands the analysis scope to multiple procedures or functions. \n",
    "It helps in understanding how data and control flow across different parts of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Points-to Analysis:** This is a technique used to determine the set of objects that a variable can point to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call Graph:** A call graph is a directed graph that represents calling relationships between functions in a program. Each node represents a function and each edge (A, B) indicates that function A calls function B.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#10145; Tasks\n",
    "- Analyze a given piece of code to build a class hierarchy. This hierarchy should capture the parent-child relationships between classes.\n",
    "- For a given class, find the highest parent in the hierarchy.\n",
    "- From the highest parent, gather all subclasses (children, grandchildren, etc.) within the hierarchy.\n",
    "- Build the points-to set using the class hierarchy"

    "### &#128161; Helper Function Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both class instantiation and function calling use the same syntax which leads to an ambiguity when analyzing the AST of a code snippet. \n",
    "Specifically, both operations appear as `ast.Call` nodes within the AST, which makes it difficult to distinguish between the two just by examining the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the following Python code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass()  # Class instantiation\n",
    "my_function()    # Function call\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the AST, both `MyClass()` and `my_function()` will be represented as `ast.Call` nodes, which could lead to misinterpretation during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue and provide clearer analysis, we present a helper function that traverses the AST to identify and categorize all class and function definitions. \n",
    "This will later help in accurately interpreting `ast.Call` nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class and Function Analyzer\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a class `ClassFunctionAnalyzer` which inherits from `ast.NodeVisitor`. \n",
    "This class overrides three methods: `visit_ClassDef`, `visit_FunctionDef`, and `visit_Call`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassFunctionAnalyzer(ast.NodeVisitor):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    A node visitor class that walks through the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to identify and record all class and function definitions within the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Attributes:\n",
    "    classes: A set to store unique class names encountered in the AST.\n",
    "    functions: A set to store unique function names encountered in the AST.\n",

    "\n",
    "    def visit_ClassDef(self, node):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Visits a class definition node, adding the class name to the classes set.\n",

    "        Determines whether a given name corresponds to a class instantiation or a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Parameters:\n",
    "        name: The name of the function or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Returns:\n",
    "        str: \"class\" if the name corresponds to a class, \"function\" if it corresponds to a function, or \"unknown\" otherwise.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        if name in self.classes:\n",
    "            return \"class\"\n",
    "        elif name in self.functions:\n",
    "            return \"function\"\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return \"unknown\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`: Initializes two sets, `classes` and `functions`, to store the names of classes and functions respectively.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `visit_ClassDef`: This method is invoked for every `ast.ClassDef` node encountered. It adds the name of the class to the `classes` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `visit_FunctionDef`: This method is invoked for every `ast.FunctionDef` node encountered. It adds the name of the function to the `functions` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `visit_Call`: This method is invoked for every `ast.Call` node encountered. It checks whether the called entity is a class or a function by comparing the identifier against the collected sets of class and function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this helper function, you will be able to determine whether an `ast.Call` node represents a class instantiation or a function call, which is important for the points-to analysis you will be performing.\n",
    "Of course, this solution is not optimal/perfect since we might have different functions with the same name in a program, but for simplicity we make the hypothesis that functions are unique. "

    "## &#128214; Exercise 2: Refining Points-to Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#127919; Objective\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we ventured into interprocedural analysis and took our first steps towards understanding the essence of Points-to Analysis by dealing with class hierarchies. \n",
    "However, the approach was quite broad, focusing on the entire class hierarchy irrespective of whether a class was instantiated or not. \n",
    "In this exercise, we aim to refine the Points-to Analysis by sharpening in on the actual class instantiations within the code, and transitioning from a flow-insensitive to a flow-sensitive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#128214; Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision in program analysis is important to understand the behavior of code and to minimize the chances of false positives or negatives. \n",
    "Two key aspects that can significantly enhance the precision of our Points-to Analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Considering Actual Class Instantiations:** Focusing on the classes that are actually instantiated in the code, as opposed to all classes in the hierarchy, can provide a more accurate picture of the possible objects a pointer can point to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flow Sensitivity:** Unlike flow-insensitive analysis, which disregards the order in which statements are executed, flow-sensitive analysis takes into account the sequence of statement execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#10145; Tasks\n",
    "1. **Refinement by Class Instantiation:**\n",
    "   - Modify your Points-to Analysis to only consider classes that are actually instantiated in the code.\n",
    "   - Analyze the given piece of code and update your Points-to set based on actual class instantiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transition to Flow-sensitive Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Adapt your Points-to Analysis to be flow-sensitive.\n",
    "   - Implement an algorithm that considers the order of statement execution to build a more precise Points-to set.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing these refinements, you will enhance the precision of your Points-to Analysis, moving closer to a more precise representation of the program's behavior across different procedural contexts. \n",
    "This exercise will further build on your understanding of interprocedural analysis, preparing you for more advanced analysis techniques."
